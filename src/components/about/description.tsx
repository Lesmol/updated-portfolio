        Born in Tzaneen and raised in the beautiful suburbs of Pretoria where I
        currently reside and study to further my knowledge of the IT industry to
        empower myself to build, manage and scale larg-scale applications.

        Beyond IT, I&apos;m an avid reader and find great pleasure in hitting
        the Golf course to develop my Golf game and register a low handicap -
        who knows, maybe I&apos;m talented enough to go pro🏌🏽‍♂️.
