summary: "Updating my site and migrating to Next.js and AWS"

## Introduction

- My website needed a serious update—not just the tech behind it but also how it looked. It needed a fresh, modern design that matched my current skills. I believe a website should show off a developer’s abilities, both in coding and creativity.

### Why Switch to Next.js?

- I really like how Next.js works. It has built-in routing, server-side rendering (SSR), and client-side rendering (CSR). Plus, I get full control over what gets generated and where.

- One big reason I chose Next.js is that I want to use it for most of my future projects. To be clear, I’m using Next.js only for front-end development. For the back end, I prefer “old-school” languages like C# and Java because they’re strong and reliable.

- Job security is another reason, but that’s a story for another time...

- Some people say, “Everything that can be done in JavaScript will eventually be done in JavaScript.” I’m not completely sold on that idea—at least not yet.

### Moving to AWS

- Since I started learning about cloud computing, I’ve wanted to use both of the top providers. Why? Honestly, I don’t know—it just feels right.

- Switching to AWS isn’t just about using what I’ve learned; it’s also my way of testing more complex setups. I’m talking about big-company-level architecture—on my tiny website that gets about three visitors a month (all of whom are me, on different devices).

- Sometimes, someone stumbles across my site through LinkedIn and is impressed that I bought a .com domain. Maybe that small effort makes them explore my site a bit. If that’s you—thank you, my friend! But I digress...

- I’ll admit, this AWS migration wasn’t completely planned. My main goal was to get hands-on experience, which I did. But in the end, it doesn’t really matter which cloud provider you use—as long as your site is online and cheap to maintain.

- Right now, the only thing I host on AWS is the images on my site. The actual website is on [Sevalla](https://sevalla.com/) because I realized hosting a Next.js site with SSR on AWS is tricky if you want to do it automatically.

- My first attempt was using an EC2 instance, and it worked! I set up my GitHub to update the site whenever I pushed code to main. All I had to do was create a cron job and—BOOM!—I had a working CD system.

- The problem? It was going to cost too much, and wasting money on unnecessary infrastructure would bring shame upon me in the eyes of the AWS gods. So, I shut it down.

- Next, I thought about using AWS Amplify. But then I got a $50 credit from [Sevalla](https://sevalla.com/), and... well, here we are. 😁

- The AWS migration isn’t finished, but I’ll get there in the next few months.

### The Design

- The design is simple—and that’s exactly what I wanted.

- I could add crazy animations that make you wonder what you’re looking at and how it was done. But that would make my life harder as a developer.

- My goal is to push out code and move on to the next project. This site isn’t a big deal, but it took me months to finish because I was busy building other things.

- The design is based on v1 but looks better. Darker colors, fewer rounded borders, a bit more animation, some gradients, and just the right amount of blue to keep things interesting.

- The first version (v1) helped me land a job. The current version (v2) is all about showing my skills and my love for writing, building, and design.

- How did I come up with the original design? I copied another site, made small changes over time, then finally did a full redesign to make it my own. I also added a blog and a projects page while removing my resume page.

- There’s still a lot I want to add, but at some point, I’ll stop maintaining this site and switch to Notion, like [Leo Radvinsky](https://leoradvinsky.com/). But we’re not there yet...

## Conclusion

- **To wrap things up**, this site is my testing ground for new ideas, projects, and whatever I find interesting. Let’s see how it evolves over time.
