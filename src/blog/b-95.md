## Introduction

My website was long overdue for an upgrade—not just in terms of the underlying technologies but also its user interface. It needed a fresh, modern look that reflected my current skill level and abilities. I firmly believe that a website's design and overall experience should align with the developer's expertise, showcasing both technical proficiency and creativity.

### Why the move to Next.js?

- I genuinely appreciate how Next.js operates, both in principle and practice. Features like built-in routing, server-side rendering (SSR), client-side rendering (CSR), and the extensive control over metadata make it an incredibly powerful tool for web development.
- A major reason for my interest is my desire to use Next.js for most, if not all, of my future projects, ventures, and experiments. **To clarify**, I plan to utilize Next.js strictly for front-end development, not for full-stack purposes. For back-end development, I remain deeply invested in expanding my expertise with so-called _"legacy languages"_ like C# and Java, which I find reliable and robust for those needs.
- While it's often said that "everything that can be done in JavaScript will eventually be done in JavaScript," I haven’t fully embraced that bandwagon—at least not yet.

## Moving over to AWS

- Ever since I was introduced to cloud platforms, I've always wanted to leverage both of the top two providers simultaneously. Why, exactly? Even I can’t fully explain — it’s a mysterious inclination. All I know is that I wanted it to be that way, and so it will be.
- The transition to AWS isn’t just about putting my knowledge of the platform into practice; it’s also my official foray into more "complex" architectures. I’m talking about enterprise-level designs, implemented on my humble little site that averages a minimum of three monthly viewers (all of whom are me, on different devices).
- Occasionally, a curious passerby stumbles upon it through LinkedIn, intrigued by the fact that I invested in a **.com** domain. That small effort to make my site feel professional might just encourage them to explore my creation — to which I say thank you my friend.
