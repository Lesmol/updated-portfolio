## Introduction

In the name of not dragging you along what could be a concise answer, I'll give you the short answer now. It's a combination of using free tiers, a budget (and carefully monitoring it), understanding the pricing of the services and just less traffic.

### Personal projects vs Commercial projects

- How I use Azure is for personal projects and they tend to use fewer resources than commercial projects. This however doesn't mean that you'll automatically pay less than 1 cent for the resources you do use since there are ways you can engineer the resources to pay more without using more.

- One way of doing this is with telemetry data (logs, app monitoring or client information).

- A big part of commercial projects is collecting data on how the app runs and how people interact with it. With that in mind, you can assume that I am clueless about how my apps run and how people interact with them and you wouldn't be wrong.

- I won't lie, it would be nice to know, but it wouldn't add much value to me. My apps are too small to collect telemetry data that will make any meaningful difference, which would not be the case for commercial projects that deal with thousands if not millions of users compared to my 10 on a good month - the number 10 is a guess by the way, I don't know how many people view my apps.

### "Generous" free tiers

- Upon signing up to Azure, you get a free tier for 12 months on popular service. These services include database offerings (Postegre, MySQL, etc.), servers (VMs), and many more specialised services. After 12 months, these free tiers are either removed or made "less generous" and some services always have a free tier, like CosmosDB.

- But even free tiers can come with additional costs if you don't know what you're doing. I've heard horror stories regarding Azure Key Vaults.

- As an example of additional costs; static web apps under the F1 plan (Free) don't come with a CDN so while my website might be fast to load in South Africa, it's a little slow in Australia. But you can get the CDN if you pay.

- You also sacrifice a few things you would get if you were a paying customer, things like an SLA, which guarantees that your services will always be available.

### Understand the pricing

- I've spent countless hours on the [Azure Pricing Page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/) and [r/Azure Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/) reading and calculating how much a service would cost me and questions other people have asked to figure it out.

- If there is one thing to put extra focus on, it's the knowledge you get from these 2 resources. You'll understand what is being charged and why, in some cases, you might learn a thing about how the service works. There is no substitute for being informed.

### The services are just cheap

- I can think of one service that I use that isn't under a free tier and is just so cheap that I don't spend money on it. It's Azure Blob Storage.

- I currently have a Terraform state file and a few images I use on my website under the Hot access tier (you pay less for read/write operations and more for storage under this tier), but since the total storage I use amounts to less then 4MB and the price for read/write operations is priced at per 10,000...

- I pay fractions of a cent for storage AND read/write operations every month.

Now, although I am accumulating costs every day (as you can see by the bars) the amounts are in the $0,0052 range each day. I assume Microsoft is just letting it accumulate to a point where they can charge me $1, but right now my invoice amounts to $0,00 every month...

### Budgets

- How budgets work is you set alerts on either forecasted or actual dollar amounts relative to the money you've budgeted to spend. When an alert is triggered it sends an email informing you and you'll act accordingly.

- I currently have a budget in place with the budgeted amount being $1, which was increased from 1 cent after an alert was triggered.

## Challenges with JavaScript Frameworks

Despite their advantages, JavaScript frameworks come with their own set of challenges:

- **Performance Overhead**: Some frameworks introduce performance overhead, especially in large applications.
- **Learning Curve**: Each framework has a learning curve, requiring time and effort to master.
- **Constant Evolution**: JavaScript frameworks are continually evolving, making it challenging to keep up with the latest changes and best practices.

## Conclusion

JavaScript frameworks have transformed web development, enabling developers to build sophisticated, high-performance applications quickly and efficiently. Although they present some challenges, the benefits they offer make them invaluable tools in today’s web development landscape.

As we look to the future, it’s clear that JavaScript frameworks will continue to evolve, introducing new features and paradigms to meet the ever-growing demands of users and developers alike.
